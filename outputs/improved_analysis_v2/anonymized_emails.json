According to clause 8.8.2 of our Master Service Agreement, the initial term of each Order Form begins on the specified date and continues for the subscription term outlined. After this, the Order Form automatically renews for additional 12-month periods unless we receive a written notice of termination at least 30 days prior to the renewal date. As we did not receive such notice, your licenses have already been activated and are accessible from day one, and we cannot roll them back or modify. Request you to please process the payment for this auto renewal invoice. We trust that these licenses will continue to support your needs effectively. We would like to point out that these automatically renewed licenses might be offered to you at a discounted rate compared to ongoing prices, providing you with significant savings. Just a heads up for the future renewals, if you wish to terminate it, please ensure to send us a termination notice at least 30 days before the current subscription ends. This will allow us to adjust our system to prevent future renewals. . Thank you for your understanding and continued partnership.

After this, the Order Form automatically renews for additional 12-month periods unless we receive a written notice of termination at least 30 days prior to the renewal date. As we did not receive such notice, your licenses have already been activated and are accessible from day one, and we cannot roll them back or modify. Request you to please process the payment for this auto renewal invoice. We trust that these licenses will continue to support your needs effectively.\\r\\n \\r\\nWe would like to point out that these automatically renewed licenses might be offered to you at a discounted rate compared to ongoing prices, providing you with significant savings.\\r\\n \\r\\nJust a heads up for the future renewals, if you wish to terminate it, please ensure to send us a termination notice at least 30 days before the current subscription ends. This will allow us to adjust our system to prevent future renewals.\\r\\n.\\r\\nThank you for your understanding and continued partnership. Please feel free to reach out if you have any questions or need further assistance.\\r\\nRegards. \\r\\nAnis Qures",
