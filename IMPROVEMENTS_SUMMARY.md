# System Prompt Improvements Summary

## Overview
Implemented three high-priority improvements to the system prompt generator based on ChatGPT-5 feedback, while maintaining organic taxonomy discovery principles.

## Implementation Date
2025-10-07

## Changes Made

### 1. ✅ Fixed Code Fence Issue

**Problem**: LLMs may echo markdown code fences (```json) in their responses, causing JSON parsing failures.

**Solution**:
- Removed all triple backticks from output format section
- Added explicit instruction: "**Return ONLY the JSON object below. No backticks, no preface, no trailing text.**"

**Impact**: Prevents parse errors in production when LLM outputs include unwanted formatting.

**Files Modified**: `pipeline/curator.py` (lines 1486-1516)

---

### 2. ✅ Hardened Entity Extraction

**Problem**: Basic entity extraction lacked normalization rules for real-world data variety.

**Solution**: Added comprehensive normalization guidelines for:
- **Invoice numbers**: Accept formats with/without dashes/spaces (INV-XXXX, INV XXXX, INVXXXX, #XXXXX)
- **Currency handling**: Multi-currency support (USD, EUR, GBP) with flexible thousand separators
- **Date normalization**: Convert absolute dates to ISO format, handle relative dates intelligently

**Impact**: More robust entity extraction across diverse email formats and international contexts.

**Files Modified**: `pipeline/curator.py` (lines 1470-1480)

---

### 3. ⚠️ Intent Gap Handling

**Problem**: Real-world emails about portal routing (Tungsten, Coupa, Ariba) and distribution list changes could fall ambiguously between categories.

**Solution**: Added process-based disambiguation rule (not category-specific):
- New rule: "When the primary action is updating contact information or submission methods (portal instructions, distribution list changes, routing preferences), classify as account/contact update"

**Impact**: Clearer classification guidance for routing/portal emails without biasing the organic taxonomy.

**Files Modified**: `pipeline/curator.py` (line 1531)

**Note**: This rule describes the PROCESS (how to classify), not the OUTPUT (specific category names), maintaining organic discovery principles.

## Validation

Created comprehensive unit test: `test_system_prompt_improvements.py`

**Test Results**: ✅ 4/4 tests passed
- ✅ No code fences present in system prompt
- ✅ Entity extraction normalization rules present
- ✅ Intent gap handling rule present
- ✅ Proper section ordering maintained

**Run Tests**:
```bash
uv run python test_system_prompt_improvements.py
```

## Comparison: Before vs After

### Before: Output Format Section
```
## OUTPUT FORMAT

Respond with ONLY a valid JSON object in this exact format:

```json
{
    "intent": "...",
    ...
}
```
```

**Issue**: Code fences may be echoed by LLM

---

### After: Output Format Section
```
## OUTPUT FORMAT

**Return ONLY the JSON object below. No backticks, no preface, no trailing text.**

{
    "intent": "...",
    ...
}
```

**Fixed**: Explicit instruction, no code fences

---

### Before: Entity Extraction
```
- Invoice numbers (formats: INV-XXXX, #XXXXX, Invoice XXXX)
- Payment amounts ($X,XXX.XX or similar currency formats)
- Dates (various formats: YYYY-MM-DD, MM/DD/YYYY, "next week", etc.)
```

**Issue**: Vague guidance on normalization

---

### After: Entity Extraction
```
- **Invoice numbers**: Accept formats with/without dashes/spaces (INV-XXXX, INV XXXX, INVXXXX, #XXXXX)
- **Payment amounts**: Normalize currency symbols and formats (USD $1,234.56, EUR €1.234,56, GBP £1,234.56)
  - Retain the currency symbol and amount
  - Accept amounts with or without thousand separators
- **Dates**: Convert to ISO format (YYYY-MM-DD) when possible
  - Absolute dates: "January 15, 2024" → "2024-01-15"
  - Relative dates: If an absolute date can be inferred, convert it; otherwise leave raw ("next Thursday")
```

**Fixed**: Explicit normalization rules for real-world variety

---

### Before: Disambiguation Rules
```
1. Primary vs Secondary: Focus on customer's PRIMARY purpose
2. Specificity: Always choose most specific category
3. Urgency: Prioritize immediate action items
4. Business Impact: Consider operational impact
```

**Issue**: No guidance for routing/portal update emails

---

### After: Disambiguation Rules
```
1. Primary vs Secondary: Focus on customer's PRIMARY purpose
2. Specificity: Always choose most specific category
3. Urgency: Prioritize immediate action items
4. Business Impact: Consider operational impact
5. Contact/Routing Updates: When primary action is updating contact
   information or submission methods (portal instructions, distribution
   list changes, routing preferences), classify as account/contact update
```

**Fixed**: Clear guidance for edge cases without hardcoding categories

---

## Organic Discovery Compliance

All changes maintain the project's commitment to organic taxonomy discovery:

✅ **No hardcoded category names** - Rule #5 describes the process, not specific output categories
✅ **No predefined examples** - Examples come from actual clustered email data
✅ **Generic consolidation logic** - Rules work with ANY category names that emerge from data
✅ **Mechanical-only enhancements** - Entity extraction rules are data normalization, not classification bias

---

## Next Steps for Phase 2

These improvements are now automatically applied every time the pipeline runs. Ready for:

1. Manual labeling of 150-250 email validation subset
2. Model performance testing (target ≥85% precision)
3. Confusion matrix analysis
4. NetSuite User Event Script integration
