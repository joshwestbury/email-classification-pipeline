# Artifacts

Production-ready deliverables and final outputs.

## Current Artifacts

### Latest Production Taxonomy
- **`taxonomy.yaml`** - Complete taxonomy with categories, definitions, and examples
- **`taxonomy_labeling_guide.md`** - Human-readable guide for email classification

### System Prompts
- **`system_prompts/`** - Production system prompts for LLM classification

## Usage

These are **read-only production artifacts**. Do not edit directly.

### Taxonomy
```bash
# View current taxonomy
cat artifacts/taxonomy.yaml

# Use in NetSuite integration
# Copy to your NetSuite project
```

### Labeling Guide
```bash
# View classification guide
cat artifacts/taxonomy_labeling_guide.md

# Use for manual labeling
# Refer to when creating validation datasets
```

## Generating New Artifacts

Artifacts are generated by the pipeline:

```bash
# Run pipeline to generate new taxonomy
python scripts/run_pipeline.py --input source_data/your_data.json --dataset-name new_run

# Find outputs in outputs/new_run/
# Review and copy approved versions to artifacts/
```

## Version History

Track artifact versions by commit:

```bash
# View taxonomy history
git log artifacts/taxonomy.yaml

# Compare versions
git diff HEAD~1 artifacts/taxonomy.yaml
```

## Best Practices

1. **Copy, don't move** - Always copy from `outputs/` to `artifacts/`
2. **Review first** - Validate quality before promoting to artifacts/
3. **Document changes** - Commit with clear messages explaining updates
4. **Keep backups** - Git history serves as version control
