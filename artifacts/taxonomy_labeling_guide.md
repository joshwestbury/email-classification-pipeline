## Difficult Cases & Edge Cases

### When Multiple Intents Appear
**Choose the PRIMARY intent** - what is the main action the customer wants?

```
Example: "The invoice amount is wrong, and when will my payment be processed?"
‚Üí Primary: Invoice Management (fixing the amount is the main issue)
‚Üí Secondary: Payment Inquiry (but this comes after the fix)
```

### When Sentiment is Mixed
**Choose the DOMINANT tone** throughout the email:

```
Example: "Thanks for your help, but this delay is really frustrating"
‚Üí Sentiment: Frustrated (despite polite opening, frustration is the main emotion)
```

### When Information is Limited
If email content is unclear or very brief:
- **Intent:** Choose Information Request (most general category)
- **Sentiment:** Choose Neutral (safest default)
- **Add note:** Flag for human review

## Quality Control Checklist

Before finalizing your categorization:

- [ ] **Intent:** Does this email's main purpose fit the chosen category?
- [ ] **Sentiment:** Does the overall tone match the chosen sentiment?
- [ ] **Exclusions:** Did I check what this email should NOT be categorized as?
- [ ] **Confidence:** Am I confident in this categorization? If not, flag for review.

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Don't confuse intent with sentiment**
   - Intent = What they want (payment info, invoice fix, general info)
   - Sentiment = How they feel (cooperative, neutral, frustrated)

2. **Don't over-analyze polite formalities**
   - "Thank you" at the end doesn't make frustrated emails cooperative

3. **Don't let subject lines override email content**
   - Focus on the email body content for categorization

4. **Don't create new categories**
   - Force-fit into existing categories or flag for taxonomy review
