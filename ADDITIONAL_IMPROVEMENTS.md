# Additional System Prompt Improvements ("A+" Reliability)

## Implementation Date
2025-10-07 (Second Round)

## Overview
After the initial three high-priority improvements, we implemented additional refinements based on ChatGPT-5's "A+ reliability" suggestions to maximize LLM classification accuracy.

---

## Changes Made

### 1. ✅ Added Explicit "DO NOT" Block

**Rationale**: Negative constraints right before output improve model compliance.

**Implementation**:
```
**CRITICAL OUTPUT REQUIREMENTS:**

DO NOT include any text before or after the JSON.
DO NOT use backticks, markdown, or code fences.
DO NOT summarize, explain, or restate the email.

**Return ONLY the JSON object below:**
```

**Impact**: Reduces output format violations and parsing errors.

**Location**: Section 7 (OUTPUT FORMAT), lines 1515-1520

---

### 2. ✅ Moved Business Priority Guidelines Before Output Format

**Rationale**: Model considers priority during token generation if it's fresh in context.

**Implementation**:
- Moved from section 10 (after examples) → section 6 (before OUTPUT FORMAT)
- Now positioned: METHODOLOGY → BUSINESS PRIORITY → OUTPUT FORMAT → DISAMBIGUATION

**Impact**: Improves business_priority field accuracy by placing guidance closer to output generation.

**Location**: Section 6 (BUSINESS PRIORITY GUIDELINES), lines 1492-1511

---

### 3. ✅ Enhanced Few-Shot Examples with Real Data

**Rationale**: Few-shot examples dramatically improve accuracy by giving models a pattern to copy.

**Implementation**:
- Renamed section from "EXAMPLES" to "FEW-SHOT EXAMPLES"
- Generate 2-3 concrete examples from `real_email_examples` in taxonomy
- Extract actual entities (invoice numbers, amounts) from email body using regex
- Infer sentiment from body content using heuristics (frustration keywords)
- Calculate appropriate business priority based on inferred sentiment

**Key Feature**: Uses **real anonymized emails from clusters** - maintains organic discovery lineage

**Example Structure**:
```
---
**EXAMPLE 1:**

EMAIL:
Subject: [actual subject from data]
Body: [actual body from data, truncated to 250 chars]

EXPECTED JSON:
{
    "intent": "Payment Confirmation and Inquiry",
    "sentiment": "Neutral Politeness",
    "confidence": 0.90,
    "reasoning": "Customer confirms payment...",
    "key_phrases": ["confirming funds have been sent", ...],
    "extracted_entities": {
        "invoice_numbers": ["INV-234"],
        "amounts": ["$1,234.56"],
        ...
    },
    ...
}
```

**Impact**: Provides concrete reference patterns that LLMs can imitate, improving classification consistency.

**Location**: Section 9 (FEW-SHOT EXAMPLES), lines 1582-1665

---

### 4. ✅ Numbered Section Headers for Better LLM Parsing

**Rationale**: Numbered sections are easier for LLMs to reference and navigate during token generation.

**Implementation**:
Changed all major headers from:
```
## INTENT CATEGORIES
## SENTIMENT CATEGORIES
## OUTPUT FORMAT
```

To:
```
## 3. INTENT CATEGORIES
## 4. SENTIMENT CATEGORIES
## 7. OUTPUT FORMAT
```

**Complete Structure**:
1. CRITICAL INSTRUCTIONS
2. CLASSIFICATION OVERVIEW
3. INTENT CATEGORIES
4. SENTIMENT CATEGORIES
5. CLASSIFICATION METHODOLOGY
6. BUSINESS PRIORITY GUIDELINES
7. OUTPUT FORMAT
8. DISAMBIGUATION RULES
9. FEW-SHOT EXAMPLES
10. CRITICAL REMINDERS

**Impact**: Improves LLM's ability to mentally index and reference different sections during classification.

**Location**: Throughout prompt generation (lines 1378-1670)

---

## Complete Improvements Summary (Both Rounds)

### Round 1 (High Priority - ChatGPT Feedback)
1. ✅ Removed code fences from output format
2. ✅ Added entity extraction normalization rules
3. ✅ Added intent gap handling for routing/portal updates

### Round 2 (A+ Reliability - Additional Refinements)
4. ✅ Added explicit "DO NOT" block before output
5. ✅ Moved business priority guidelines before output format
6. ✅ Enhanced few-shot examples with real email data
7. ✅ Numbered all major section headers (1-10)

---

## Organic Discovery Compliance

All improvements maintain organic taxonomy discovery principles:

✅ **Few-shot examples use real data** - Examples generated from `real_email_examples` in clustered data
✅ **No synthetic category bias** - Sentiment/priority inferred from actual email content
✅ **Entity extraction from real text** - Regex patterns extract actual invoice numbers and amounts
✅ **No hardcoded category assumptions** - Examples adapt to whatever categories emerge from data

---

## Validation

Run tests to verify improvements:

```bash
uv run python test_system_prompt_improvements.py
uv run python generate_sample_prompt.py
```

**Expected Results**:
- ✅ 4/4 original tests pass
- ✅ DO NOT block present
- ✅ Business Priority before OUTPUT FORMAT
- ✅ Numbered section headers (1-10)
- ✅ FEW-SHOT EXAMPLES section present (populated when real data available)

---

## Files Modified

- `pipeline/curator.py` - Updated `generate_system_prompt()` method
  - Lines 1378-1670 (major refactoring)
  - +89 lines, -61 lines (net +28 lines)

---

## Expected Impact on Phase 2

These "A+ reliability" improvements should:

1. **Reduce parsing errors** - DO NOT block and explicit output constraints
2. **Improve business priority accuracy** - Earlier positioning in prompt
3. **Increase classification consistency** - Few-shot examples provide concrete patterns
4. **Better LLM navigation** - Numbered sections easier to reference mentally

**Target Metrics**:
- Parsing success rate: >99%
- Intent classification precision: ≥85% (unchanged target)
- Business priority accuracy: ≥90% (new target)
- Overall classification consistency: +10-15% improvement expected

---

## Next Steps

1. Run full pipeline on production dataset to generate real few-shot examples
2. Validate output format compliance in Phase 2 testing
3. Measure classification consistency improvement vs baseline
4. Consider A/B testing old vs new prompt on validation subset
